			What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
			and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
			dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
			of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived
			not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
			typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
			the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
			passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
			Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. <br /> Where does
			it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply
			random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature
			from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
			professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
			more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
			going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
			discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
			1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
			of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
			on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
			first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from
			a line in section 1.10.32. <br /> The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum
			used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
			Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by
			Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied
			by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
